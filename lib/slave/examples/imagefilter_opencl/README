--How to Compile--
First Of all make sure you have installed the OpenCL enabled drivers.

Second make sure you have installed NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK. 

Third make sure that you have the path to NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/ exported to OPENCL_HOME (the path could be /home/user/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/OpenCL)

Forth run the Makefile. 

Done. 

--How to run--

run the application by typeing 
>./filter s input_file.ppm > result_file.ppm

if you run just 
>./filter 

you will get the options of this program. 

usage:filter <type|(s)harpen (b)lur (g)rayscale (e)mboss> <input_image_filename>

Unfortuneatly it is only the s option that is implemented in this version. 
So running with another option will not give any valueable result.

--Known Issues---
